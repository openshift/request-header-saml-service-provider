== TODO:

. make RH-SSO template persistent (otherwise restarts create new server certs)
. Uninett bug - can't pipe log to anything, reads pipe as part of filename
  [Thu Mar 28 02:39:17.165645 2019] [:error] [pid 1] (2)No such file or directory: could not open mellon diagnostics log file /etc/httpd/|/usr/bin/cat.

 https://github.com/Uninett/mod_auth_mellon/blob/master/auth_mellon_diagnostics.c#L325

. Uninett bug - MellonSetEnv must be in same block

. Update README.md

 . Test manual steps and add push/pop back as needed

. Test out RH-SSO deployment with prepared empty configmap, to be updated later rather than added newly, so that it does not create a new deployment

. Add health check page, since logout redirects back to login
